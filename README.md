# julia_notes
Notes and resources for learning Julia, esp. in the context of mixed models.

Includes:
  - My personal notes from [SMLP2021](https://github.com/kyla-mcconnell/julia_notes/blob/main/smlp2021.jl) as a Pluto notebook
  - Old notes from [SMLP2020](https://github.com/kyla-mcconnell/julia_notes/blob/main/smlp2020.md) 
  - [Basic Julia syntax](https://github.com/kyla-mcconnell/julia_notes/blob/main/basic_julia.jmd) from [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/p/intro-to-julia)

Errors my own, I'm sure there are some, feel free to suggest changes.
